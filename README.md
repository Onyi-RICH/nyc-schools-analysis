# 🗽 NYC Schools Analysis

This **nyc-schools-analysis** project was completed as part of my **Onboarding Process as an Intern at [Webeet.io](https://webeet.io)**.

The primary objective was to gain **hands-on experience with real-world data stacks and workflows**, while strengthening my understanding of **GitHub collaboration** — including branch creation, commits, pull requests, and code review processes.

Throughout the project, I also honed my skills in **Google Sheets**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflows.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The repository is organized into four key sections, each focusing on a different stage of the data analytics and database integration workflow:

### 1. [Incident Analysis](https://github.com/Onyi-RICH/nyc-schools-analysis/tree/main/incident_analysis)

**File:** `school-safety-report.csv`
**Tool:** Google Sheets

**Description:**
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Google Sheets.
Standardized column names, cleaned the dataset, and used pivot tables to explore **school safety incidents** across NYC.
Summarized borough-level insights, identified trends, and evaluated incident types.

---

### 2. [School Directory Exploration](https://github.com/Onyi-RICH/nyc-schools-analysis/tree/main/school_directory_exploration)

**File:** `high-school-directory.csv`
**Tool:** Python (VS Code Notebook)

**Description:**
Loaded and explored the NYC High School Directory dataset using **Pandas**.
Cleaned data, analyzed demographics and programs, and answered guided analysis questions within a Jupyter notebook environment.

---

### 3. [Database Queries](https://github.com/Onyi-RICH/nyc-schools-analysis/tree/main/database_queries)

**Tool:** Python (VS Code Notebook) + SQL

**Description:**
Connected to a **PostgreSQL database** using `psycopg2.connect` and executed SQL queries directly from the notebook.
Practiced writing **joins, aggregations, and filtering** to extract meaningful insights from school data.
Identified **data inconsistencies** and proposed standardization strategies for improved accuracy.

---

### 4. [Database Population](https://github.com/Onyi-RICH/nyc-schools-analysis/tree/main/database_population)

**File:** `sat-results.csv`
**Tool:** Python (VS Code Notebook)

**Description:**
Designed a database schema and implemented a full **ETL workflow**.
Cleaned and validated SAT results data (e.g., score range checks, NULL handling, header normalization).
Uploaded the cleaned dataset to the PostgreSQL database while ensuring **data integrity and consistency**.
